
Graph is a data structure that consists of following two components:
1. A finite set of vertices also called as nodes.
2. A finite set of ordered pair of the form (u, v) called as edge. The pair is ordered because (u, v) is not same as (v, u) in case of a directed graph(di-graph). 
The pair of the form (u, v) indicates that there is an edge from vertex u to vertex v. The edges may contain weight/value/cost.

Graphs are used to represent many real-life applications: Graphs are used to represent networks. The networks may include paths in a city or telephone network 
or circuit network. Graphs are also used in social networks like linkedIn, Facebook. For example, in Facebook, each person is represented with a vertex(or node). 
Each node is a structure and contains information like person id, name, gender and locale.

Following two are the most commonly used representations of a graph.
1. Adjacency Matrix
2. Adjacency List
There are other representations also like, Incidence Matrix and Incidence List. The choice of the graph representation is situation specific. 
It totally depends on the type of operations to be performed and ease of use.

Implementation of Graphs using Adjacency List:

An array/dictionary of lists is used. Size of the array/dictionary is equal to the number of vertices. Let the array be array[]. 
An entry array[i] represents the list of vertices adjacent to the ith vertex. This representation can also be used to represent a weighted graph. 
The weights of edges can be represented as lists of pairs.
